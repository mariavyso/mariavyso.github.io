## Summary:
I built a 3D‑printed anatomical‑heart handbag, quickly learn new tools: Onshape and Blender. Sharped my patience and improved my problem-solving skills. Obsessively prototyped and documented every step brinning my data-engineering skills to DIY.

## Tools, I leaned on:
Onshape, Blender

I’ve been dreaming about 3D‑printing something wearable for ages, but I wanted something fancier (and bigger) than earrings or bracelets.

## The inspiration

It all started in Spring 2021, when Gucci dropped their Aria collection. I spotted that crystal embellished anatomical heart clutch, immediately fell in love, and promptly messaged my friend: "I need it!".

Fast‑forward: it’s retailing for around [$6K on resale platform](https://us.vestiairecollective.com/women-bags/handbags/gucci/?product_id=44641545&setLocale=6.en.USD&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21013742112&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwna6_BhCbARIsALId2Z1wV0lnegNEo6LZuD62njqu2UJ87tjSWGSj-GhY7M2FtgC5S5yPEI0aArHIEALw_wcB), which is not in my budget.

Lesson learned: some fashion dreams are meant for admiring, not owning.

3 years later, I took a styling course (please don’t ask) to remind myself that there is more to wardrobes than Lululemon leggins and Patagonia vests (sorry SF). This makes me realize how many pieces could be repurposed and restyled if you have enough inspiration and find your creative mode. Around that time, my friend bought a 3d printer and I was a bit sceptic about it, but sometimes during the styling course I found myself on a [printables](https://www.printables.com/) looking for a 3d model of the earrings that I needed ASAP. The only thing that frustrated me was that I didn’t know much about post-processing of the PLA, and after a few YouTube videos, I was still not sure that the piece that I make wouldn't look like cheap plastic. Skill issue, as you may notice.

After a while I saw somewhere the JW Anderson’s pigeon clutch.

It looks so cringy and yet fun, that I can’t stop myself from thinking that this piece could be 3d printed and I can make it myself.
But the hollow plastic body and imagined jangle of keys inside reminded me that it wasn't build with the purpose of serving you as a real clutch.

When Instagram feed later showed me a mini‑bag with the same unlined interior, I knew: I must 3D‑print my own handbag and it would be quieter, roomier, and totally bespoke.

## The planning stage

It needs to be said that my previous experience with 3d modeling tools was very limited and painful. Before starting this project, I spent some hours in Onshape trying to resize and change the plant pot model, which I found on Thingverse, and created a very simple laptop stand. It is really challenging for me to imagine how I can create a 3d object from the circles, lines and dots.

**Before jumping in, I wrote down exactly what I don't like about my inspiration bags:**

1. tiny usable volume.
    Weird open placement, which leaves you the space to fit only a key and lip gloss there.
2. unlined plastic interior.
    Which probably looks good enough as in the Gucci example, but still your every step will produce a sound like you carrying a bag full of coins.
3. the opening system, such as a "suitcase" or a "Minaudière".
    When you have both pieces connected together via a magnet and a hinge. And I just don’t like the hinge part, plus it would be hard to do at home with minimal post-processing.

**Thus, my goals were framed into:**
1. Maximize internal space by rethinking the split line
2. Silence the rattle with a lined interior
3. Create an opening system that will be easy to install and easy to draw in Onshape

## 3d modelling and prototyping

I was able to find an open-source [model of the anatomical heart](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:932606) that I like mostly because it was hollow inside, and with trial and error, I cut it in a way that I wanted, not in half as in my references, but in a way where I have more usable space. Thus, goal 1 - checked!

I decided on using 4 magnets on the each part of the bag as a closing system, so the goal 3 is checked as well. I spent way more time than needed on adding the magnet placements to the model, but I didn’t give up. This is a part of learning a new tool, right?

After printing the prototypes, I realized that while using the real anatomical heart is cool, I needed a flatter back so both cross‑body and top‑handle straps would sit right and the bag wouldn't bulged uncomfortably against my side. Onshape hit its limits, so I switched to Blender. It was a steep learning curve, actually. My first take was to go with the flow and just use the knowledge I had from working with Onshape, and of course, I broke a lot of manifolds and was very frustrated. This very humbling experience reminded me about the importance of learning and researching before jumping ahead of the train.
A few months later, I finally had a cap that’s both comfortable and with a good shape.

## Lining and handles

I knew from the start that I needed to put the black velvet inside the red plastic heart. But I completely forgot that velvet is really hard to work with, especially without experience and a sewing machine. But I came up with an *innovative* solution -to glue the velvet to the thin soft foam, which I planned to glue inside of both parts of the bag. However, the soft foam that I have was very thin and during the tests, I found that it wouldn’t be enough, so I layer thicker recycled packing foam underneath for extra cushioning and total silence when keys are inside. The second goal was achieved, and this solution worked even better than I expected!

The handle placement was chosen with trial and error, and if I were to do this one more time, I’d create the holes for the attachment leather loops at the modelling stage. In this project, I made it by melting small holes in the shell by heating thick copper wire with solder. Then I formed leather rope loops, inserted them into holes, and glued them in place inside the shell. Then I seal each loop with a coat of epoxy over the glue for strength.

For the long cross-body strap, I used flat leather cord secured to attachment loops with Chicago studs. You can easily replace it with the short handle, that made of silk braided rope and 3d printed end rope caps with hooks.

I didn't use any metal pieces, besides magnets, in this bag, to avoid possible noise.

## Printing and final touch

**20‑hour marathon print** on my home machine is the longest yet, but turned out flawless.
I was surprised that modern slicers let you design surface texture in the file itself, so I chose a surface texture that highlights the heart’s anatomy.

This is how the bag looks in the wild.

Cargo capacity is great! It can fit keys, lip balm and even a full cardholder. Intentionally not your phone, so you can enjoy life offline for a while.

## Aftermath

Who knew that printing a heart handbag would turn into a crash course in rapid tool switching? I bounced from Onshape to Blender without too many existential crises, opted for a simpler solution with glue for the lining part, and became embarrassingly picky about foam thickness. All those prototype rounds and glue‑and‑epoxy marathons supercharged my learning, relentless iteration, and document‑everything habits, the very same instincts that keep my data pipelines humming.
